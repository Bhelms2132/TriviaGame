# TriviaGame
This app was developed to demonstrate my ability to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

I declared the variables needed then created the javascript functions. Some of the issues I encountered
was, how to prevent the user from being able to continue selecting answers once the timer ran out of time. 
After talking my code, it was a simple fix by adding "displayResults()" in the javascript function decrement. 
Now once the time runs out, the app displays the results preventing the user from continuing with guesses.

There are seven questions with multipule answers within an array, more questions and answers can easly be added to the app by adding them within the array.

Instructions:  You are given seven total questions with multipule choice answers. The user must answer within the fifty second time frame or the game will end displaying the results of the questions the user has answered
